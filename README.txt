Social connections analyzer based on common pictures



Introduction:
	In this project we created a system in order to predict social connections
	based on common pictures.



Algorithm:
	1. Cut off the faces of each picture in the dataset
	2. Extract features for each face picture
	3. Cluster the faces
	4. Create and visualize the connections



Types of visualizations:
	1. Personal Pictures
	Showing all the pictures of which the cluster took place in
	
	2. Personal Connections
	Showing all the people the cluster is connected to (sorted)
	
	3. Connection's Pictures
	Showing all the common pictures of a connection



Instructions:
	1. Place the pictures in the Data directory (in the project's main directory)
	2. Click "Generate Connections"
	3. Wait until the results will appear
